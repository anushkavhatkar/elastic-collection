    Welcome to Loom, a project that celebrates the incredible artistry and creativity of Indian textiles. With this collection, I wanted to create an online reference point for Desi aesthetics that could inspire and educate others about the rich heritage of Indian textiles. 

    <br><br>I have curated a collection of fabrics, prints, weaves, and designs from different regions of India, with the goal of showcasing the range of styles and techniques used by Indian artisans. 
    
    <br><br>I hope this website provides a platform for learning and appreciation of the beauty of Indian textiles. Thank you for visiting and sharing my passion for Indian textiles!
